## Workflow: Basics
## Coding Basics
R can be used as simple calculator:


```r
1 / 200 * 30
```

```
## [1] 0.15
```

Assigning in R usually goes with "<-", but I prefer classical "=" sign. Basically R is like all other 
programming languages. We can assign to a variable different values, call some functions, etc.
